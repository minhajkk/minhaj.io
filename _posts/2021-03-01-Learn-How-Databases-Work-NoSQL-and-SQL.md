> Databases are what you use to store data in all applications and there are two main ways to store data in a database: SQL and NOSQL, but how are they different?

In this meetup, we'll be going over:

- How databases work
- How we use databases with backend systems, API's and apps
- What an SQL database is
- What a NOSQL database is
- How to relate tables together (using keys)
- How NOSQL relates data (in an unstructured way)
- Which database is better? (we actually have an answer)

[Hope to see you there!](https://www.meetup.com/Astrolabs-Digital-Tech/events/276380848/)

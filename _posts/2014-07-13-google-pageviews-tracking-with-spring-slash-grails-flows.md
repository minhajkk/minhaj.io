If youâ€™re working with spring/grails flows!! tracking page views of each step of flow as different url with google analytics could be real a pain.
<br/><br/>
However to succeed in dealing with this issue use `_trackPageview` method along with a URL in order to track different url than original(in address bar). e.g.
{% highlight javascript %}
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/checkout/step1']);
{% endhighlight %}
Instead of
<br/>
{% highlight javascript %}
_gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);
{% endhighlight %}

I just passed scjp 310-065 exam today morning with 96% score got 2 questions wrong the score i was expecting is 98% after clicked on finish but never less I'm quit satisfy with current score as well, the exam was quit easy for me(perhaps, am lucky one to get easier questions)
<br/><br/>
First of all i would like to thanks Bert & Kathy for such a wonderful book, their book [SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Exam](http://www.amazon.com/SCJP-Certified-Programmer-Java-310-065/dp/0071591060) is absolutely perfect for the java professionals like me, but if you are beginner i would recommend **scjp guide** by Khalid Mughal & Rolf Rasmussen.  
2nd i would like to thanks from bottom of my heart to all my rancher fellows for keep asking and answering such great & helpful questions.  

#### Some notes i recommend for passing SCJP:

- clear your all basic concepts on OO(i.e inheritance, encapsulation, coupling and etc)
- check java.io.File methods.
- check TreeSet & HashSet methods thoroughly.
- read collection & generics from mughal & rasmussen guide.
- clear the concepts on exceptions(i.e checked and unchecked exception, which are thrown by programmer??)
- proper usage of wait/notify/notifyall in threads.
- do remember usage of compareTo(), equals() and hashCode() methods(including proper implementation)
- remember you can only compare inequality of a object by hashCode() not equality.

In last i would appreciate the efforts of Paul Wheaton(owner of [java ranch website](http://www.coderanch.com/)) to gather such a huge java crowd here A really big applause for him

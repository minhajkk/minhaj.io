In today’s world marketers need zoomed in technology to sneak into individual customers requirements Oracle marketing cloud provide marketers the most advanced and easy to use cloud based solutions for unifying customer data, engaging the right audience across different channels and analyzing performance. 

Oracle marketing cloud is the perfect way of personalizing experiences towards boosting revenue, advocacy and engagement through social marketing, content and cross-channel solutions with integrated data activation and management. In a nutshell, marketing complexity is simplified through a very powerful platform, customers are engaged through content intelligently, deploy solutions trusted by IT and loved by marketers come into play as you unify programs and data across diverse digital channels. 

**Oracle Responsys Marketing Suite** is a part of this critical oracle marketing cloud and I have had a wonderful experience working on its integration.

## Responsys integration 

Working together with the marketing team, we were able to bring the Responsys integration project home and actualize it for our organization. It is a different manner of doing customer interactions where rather than focus on campaigns delivered to a crowd or a broad audience marketing is orchestrated to deliver related interactions added together throughout the channels. After some time, you are able come up with a unique experience for every crucial customer. To actualize this, I had the pleasure of working on a number of integrations. 

## Responsys Rest API

Through integrate Responsys rest API, user data is synchronized through two unique API's; "Managing a List" and "Authenticating" for the integration to be complete. The purpose for this integration is the synchronization of the user's data like ID, name and email with the Responsys database to allow the marketing team to use the information in newsletters or campaigns. The main reason behind this vital integration is that the marketing team does not have to rely on the IT team in the provision of data feeds to use while deploying campaigns. 

## WRS (Web Retargeting Service) Integration

This is another integration I was able to work with. Through the Web Retargeting Service (WRS), we are able to capture diverse types of web behaviors of their users that can be used later in Remarketing Campaigns such as Post Purchase, Search, Browse, and Abandoned Cart, among others.  For WRS to work, the sequence of users from one page to the next does not have to follow a certain order. Rather users can arrive at any of your website's pages and WRS will begin capturing the web behavior of the user right from that point. 
WRS accomplishes this through Javascript "tags" code inserted into a page. The only required thing is for WRS tags to be there on a specific page and the web behavior associated will be captured. In this regard, different kinds of tags are used in capturing diverse kinds of web behaviors and the good thing is they can be applied on the same online page to allow you to capture multiple behaviors and tie them to a specific user.

WRS offer couple of few tags to track down the different events and actions of users, such as:
<br/>
`► trackPageView - To track page views.`
`► trackViewProductCategory - To track the product category page views.`
`► trackViewProduct - To track the product detail page views.`
`► trackAddProductToCart - To track 'add to cart' event.`
`► trackCartCheckout - To track checkout event.`
`► trackCartPurchased - To track successful purchase/transaction  event.`
    
## Connect Jobs 

This is another integration I have worked with. We've setup couple of connect jobs to synchronize orders and product data with responsys db as well as download user's behavior data captured by WRS so that a new section on the website can be added for returning users to upsell relevant product. This allows the marketing team to utilize the automation and program to their advantage and make better decisions in the process.

There is more to Responsys...

## Data layers

In Responsys, there are three types of data tables that can be created. This is the Contact List(s) or CL referring to the primary user data, PET(s) or Profile Extensions which is the profile data extensions and Supp(s) or Supplementary Tables, for instance orders. The relationship of Contact Lists to Profiles Extensions is 1:1. It is possible to come up with multiple lists in a single account that allows you to actualize two marketing models, for example when a separate kind of B2B list is a good idea. 

## Personalization in campaigns 

Essentially, there are two main ways of carrying out personalization in campaigns. This includes the use of Built-in functions and Responsys Personalization Language or RPL in short.

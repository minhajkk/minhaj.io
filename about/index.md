I'm a Senior & Backend-Lead developer at <a href="//www.cobone.com" target="_blank">Cobone</a> & <a href="//www.safarna.com" target="_blank">Safarna</a> developing and designing service oriented solutions and definitely exploring new frontiers are something I adore. Apart from codeing, chess, scrum, payment gateways and e-marketing are some of the other passions that define me. My experience in developing service oriented solutions through java and other open source stacks has given me a lot of pleasure. I love combining java with other open source frameworks which sharpen my design and analytical skills.
<br /><br />
Currently I’m responsible for the expansion, support and maintenance of the Cobone group buying platform, including the booking platform upon which the website is running. I’m also at the helm guiding in the performance of feasibility studies, implementing and designing new feature mapping business admin and marketing requirements, together with the integration of platforms with a number of external systems. I’m highly involved in practical agile methodologies implementation in test-driven surroundings with pair programming, version control and continuous integration server. I’m also involved in deploying, testing, developing and designing end to end solutions for the Group’s main websites and the internal management system of content as well as teaming up with other designers to convert designs into flexible and cogent HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
